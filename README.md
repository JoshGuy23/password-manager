# Password Manager

## Introduction

A simple password manager program.

## Instructions

To use the password manager, enter the website you need a password for, your email or username, and your password, hit 'Add', then hit 'OK' in the confirmation window.
Hit 'Cancel' in the confirmation window if you want to change anything.

Hitting 'Generate Password' generates a random password to be stored in the password manager. The button also copies the password to your clipboard.

Entering information into the 'Website' entry and hitting 'Search' will return the relevant email/username and password if the website entry exists.

All information is stored in a text file called "data.json".

Please note that you cannot leave any field blank, or else you will get an error message.
